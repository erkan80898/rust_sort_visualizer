# Rust Sort Visualizer #

A multi-sorting algorithm visualizer implemented in rust.


After building and running with "cargo run" a terminal will appear
asking for: 

* List size
* Minimum possible value within the list
* Maximum possible value within the list
* Sorting algorithm to use
* Sorting order 

After entering those values, a window will pop up that will graphically
show the steps of the sorts.

If you close the window, you will be brought back to the start
where, if you wish, could run another simulation.
* Note: This will use a different seed so the list will not be the same as the last iteration
 
To end the program, enter Ctrl-C

*Note: The goal of this was to get more familiar with rust, especially with design patterns and involving other crates.*
