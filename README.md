# Rust Sort Visualizer #

###A simple multi-sorting algorithm visualizer implemented in rust.###


After building and running with "cargo run" a terminal will appear
asking for: 

* List size
* Minimal possible value within the list
* Maximal possible value within the list
* Sorting algorithm to use
* Sorting order 

After entering those values, a window will pop up that will graphically
show the steps of the sorts.

If you close the window, you will be brought back to the start
where, if you wish, could run another simulation.
* Note: This will use a different seed so the list will not be the same as the last iteration
 
To end the program, enter Ctrl-C

**Note:The goal of this was to get more familar with rust and try to get
familiar with it, especially with design patterns.**
